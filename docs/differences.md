There are a lot of libraries for validation. The question is: why to use this one? I began with this library because
none of the existing was what I was looking for. Ok, of course I did not check all libraries - there are too many.

Here I want to show 3 libraries with typical code and why I prefer verja over them.

### respect/validation

### vlucas/valitron

### wixel/gump
